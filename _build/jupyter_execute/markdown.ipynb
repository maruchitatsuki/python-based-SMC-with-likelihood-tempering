    "# Markdown Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you write your book's content in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or\n",
    "in regular markdown files (`.md`), you'll write in the same flavor of markdown\n",
    "called **MyST Markdown**.\n",
    "This is a simple file to help you get started and show off some syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MyST?\n",
    "\n",
    "MyST stands for \"Markedly Structured Text\". It\n",
    "is a slight variation on a flavor of markdown called \"CommonMark\" markdown,\n",
    "with small syntax extensions to allow you to write **roles** and **directives**\n",
    "in the Sphinx ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more about MyST, see [the MyST Markdown Overview](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Roles and Directives\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles and directives are two of the most powerful tools in Jupyter Book. They\n",
    "are kind of like functions, but written in a markup language. They both\n",
    "serve a similar purpose, but **roles are written in one line**, whereas\n",
    "**directives span many lines**. They both accept different kinds of inputs,\n",
    "and what they do with those inputs depends on the specific role or directive\n",
    "that is being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a \"note\" directive:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Here is a note\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,\n",
    "the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like\n",
    "this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:\n",
    "The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to\n",
    "render properly.\n",
    "For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,\n",
    "then the bibliography is inserted with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{bibliography}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn more\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a simple starter to get you started.\n",
    "You can learn a lot more at [jupyterbook.org](https://jupyterbook.org)."
